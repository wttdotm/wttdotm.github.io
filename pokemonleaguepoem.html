    <p>this flows way better</p>
    <p>like i said, difficult thing to track is going to be individual kills. will be hilarious to have the stats tho</p>
    <p>yeah exactly, if people do it right away it'll be fine but if you wait it'll be ass to go through the replay</p>
    <p>what constitutes a kill</p>
    <p>sometimes you just sack something because yous ack something and it dies to rocks or hazards or something lol</p>
    <p>ok two ways to do that, either it's just whoever caused the last damage that it took, so in that case whoever put out the hazards</p>
    <p>or you just leave it up to the battler, whoever you think deserves the kill the most gets awarded the kill</p>
    <br/>
    <p>if we only track deaths and appearances, then you can get a survival rate for each mon which would still be hilarious</p>
    <p>without having the annoyance of having to who killed what</p>
    <p>that make sense?</p>
    <p>i'm down to track it, i feel like others just might not track it and i don't want have to track it for them</p>
    <p>down either way</p>
    <p>we could also count appearances, deaths and OHKOs</p>
    <p><b>stats that everyone can easily track: appearances, deaths.</b></p>
    <p><b>stats that i'm down to track: whatever</b></p>
    <p><b>stats that i'm not down to track: other people's whatever</b></p>
    <p>yes, the more i think about it the more i thinkOHKOs are really funny so i'll probably track my own OHKOs</p>
    <p><b>kevin will track anything under the sun he tracked mario baseball</b></p>
    <br/>
    <p>thus i think it makes the most sense to do only appearances and deaths. Kills are the easiest to track that aren't those other 2. would be down for those 2 or those 3</p>
    <p>kevin tracking mario baseball is worthwhile input</p>
    <br/>
    <p>i think we just ask the group and see if they're all down, if they are we do all three, if not, then just deaths and appearances</p>
    <p>yah im down</p>
    <p>this is a funny conversation i'm going to leave it here</p>
