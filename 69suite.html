    <p><i>i am of the opinion that the easiest way to produce something interesting or learn something new is to work on the stupidest possible version of it. to that end, i have, periodically, used 69 (lol) as a recurrent theme in my work to force this stupidity. i have found this extremely generative, and encourage you to try it out for yourself. it is amazing the mental blocks you can get past. the path from ridiculous to engaging is probably much easier than whatever you are trying these days.</i></p>
