        <p>Morry Kolman (WTTDOTM) is an award-winning independent multimedia artist and developer born and raised in NYC. His work has been featured internationally in media outlets such as GQ, The Guardian, Vice, Fast Company, The Verge, and art institutions such as the Museum of the Moving Image, Rhizome, and Gray Area. He creates interactive and entertaining ways to demystify, make legible, or upend the technological and cultural forces that affect us everyday. With a background in visual theory and science and technology studies, he is especially interested in the differences of perception and processing that separate humans from machines, and the potentials for expression, meaning, or subversion come out of that gap. He currently lives in Brooklyn with a very cluttered desk and his two cats.</p>
